Molekel 5.2.0 beta supports shaders and GUI events record/playback to be
used mainly for automated testing. This document gives some information on
how to show some of the Molekel features through pre-recorded event
sequences. 

In the rest of this document molekel is supposed to be installed into
/apps/csvis/molekel. 


Basic display settings
----------------------

* Liquorice: creates a 'liquorice' representation of the selected molecule
          
1) launch molekel with a molecule in it:
   molekel /apps/csvis/molekel/data/CATENE/film-ring1.xyz
2) select molecule by cliking on its name in the tree view
3) open event player widget (interaction->event player)
4) select file 'liquorice_after_molecule_selected.events'
5) click on play

Shaders
-------

For both examples it's a good idea to first set the molecule display
settings to liquorice either manually (stick, bonds-round cap) or running
the liquorice script.

* Basic shader: applies a shader and reads the shader parameters from file
 
1) launch molekel with a molecule in it:
   molekel /apps/csvis/molekel/data/CATENE/film-ring1.xyz
2) select molecule by cliking on its name in the tree view
3) open event player widget (interaction->event player)
4) select file 'apply_shader_after_molecule_selected.events'
5) click on play

* Surface shader: generates the solvent excluded surface and applies
                  x-ray shader to surface

For this shader to work molekel needs to know the path to the msms
program that performs some computation needed for the surface generation.
Before running this script select a molecule, open the surfaces->SES dialog
and verify that the full path to the msms executable is displayed in the
dialog; select the executable in case it's not then close the dialog. 

1) launch molekel with a molecule in it:
   molekel /apps/csvis/molekel/data/CATENE/film-ring1.xyz
2) select molecule by cliking on its name in the tree view
3) open event player widget (interaction->event player)
4) select file 'msms_and_x-ray_shader_after_molecule_selected.events'
5) click on play

Electron density surfaces
-------------------------

*Density Matrix: generates a surface from density matrix info, color codes
                 with Molecular Electrostatic Potential and shows
                 MEP scalar bar

1) launch molekel with a molecule in it:
   molekel /apps/csvis/molekel/data/aceticacidg98.log
2) select molecule by cliking on its name in the tree view
3) open event player widget (interaction->event player)
4) select file 'density_matrix_mep_after_molecule_selected.events'
5) click on play

Animation
---------

*Atom coordinates (pdb and xyz): change display settings and shows
                                 an animating pdb; this script will
                                 select the first molecule in the
                                 tree and change the display settings
                                 of that molecule before starting
                                 the animation

1) launch molekel with a molecule in it:
   molekel /apps/csvis/molekel/data/alaninemulti.pdb
2) open event player widget (interaction->event player)
3) select file 'simple_animation.events'
4) click on play

Bond/Atom Interaction
---------------------

*Angle: computes angle between two bonds

Molekel 5.3 tests
=================

This document lists a number of use cases to ensure that the basic features
are supported. No low level details are given on how to complete a specific
operation where multiple options are available, the goal is simply to guarantee
that there is at least one way to complete a specific operation.
E.g. thre are 7 different ways to load a file without using the keyboard for
navigation or typing the file name:

 1 command line
 2 toolbar button + mouse: doubleclick on file
 3 toolbar button + mouse: select file and press open
 4 File menu + mouse: doubleclick on file
 5 File menu + mouse: select file and press open  
 6 Keyboard accelerator + mouse: doubleclick on file
 7 Keyboard accelerator + mouse: select file and press open
 
Add to the above keyboard navigation and explicit typing of the file name
and you'll get a lot more.

Environment
-----------

Set settings to:
  io/indatadir = <build dir>/test/data
  io/ineventsdir = <build dir>/test/test_cases/<platform>
  io/outdatadir = <build dir>/test/out
  io/outsnapshotsdatadir = <build dir>/test/out
  io/shaders = <build dir>/test/data/shaders
  msmsexecutable = <msms executable path> e.g. C:/programs/msms_win32_6.2.1/msms.exe

Make sure that EOLs are correct using unix2dos on windows and dos2unix on UNIX/Mac in test/data.

Always exit through File->Exit menu item.

Use black background and do not unselect molecules before saving images unless
explicitly stated in test case.

----------
Test Cases
----------

The following test cases are intended to be run sequentially  in the same

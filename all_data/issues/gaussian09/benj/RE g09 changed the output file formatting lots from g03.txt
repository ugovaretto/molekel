Hi Ugo,
I just sent an email with a few attachments.  In case they are large enough 
that they don't reach you (our system tends to eat emails with large 
attachments) please let me know and I'll ftp them to you.
Thanks,
Benj

here they decided to get rid of Gaussian so I won't even have sample output or 
anything that could help me update the Gaussian readers.

both
G03 and G09 and check the output but it won't be possible.

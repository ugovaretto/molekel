Ugo,
Of course, I'm glad to help.  I've attached 4 files, 2 irc's and 2 geometry 
optimizations.  The 2 irc's are from the same TS, but different directions.  
The UCCSD geometry opt calculates the frequencies at the end.  The UMP2 
geometry opt has calcall in there, so the frequency info should be all over 
the place (in the past calcall caused Molekel to read in each vib twice).
Thanks and let me know if I can be of any more help, Benj

here they decided to get rid of Gaussian so I won't even have sample output or 
anything that could help me update the Gaussian readers.

G03 and G09 and check the output but it won't be possible.

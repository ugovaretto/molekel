This file describes how to build molekel in 4 steps using
the scripts provided in the build dir.
For this pocess to work all the required dependecies have
to be installed; check build.txt for detailed information
on how to add the required dependencies.

1) Get the checkout script:
   svn export svn://bioinformatics.org/svnroot/molekel/trunk
2) sh checkout.sh svn
   checks out the required files in ./svn
3) Change ./svn/build/run_xxx_cmake.sh setting the include
   and library paths properly
4) Build. Two options here:
     a) build everything in the dist dir:
        run sh ./svn/build/run_xxx_cmake.sh
     b) build and package for distribution
        run sh ./svn/build/build_xxx.sh
        This requires setting the path to NSIS installer on windows

On Unix and Windows  you need to copy all the dependent DLLs in a
directory specified in the run_xxx_cmake.sh script. The default is to
use molekel_dll dir in the current directory, so on linux another option
is to simply link ./molekel_dll to wherever the libraries are.

To perform a full build producing a re-distributable package:
- Windows: install Nullsoft installer (NSIS) and specify the
  installation path in ./svn/build/build_mingw.sh
- Mac: update ./svn/install/mac/fixpath.sh to point to the right
  paths

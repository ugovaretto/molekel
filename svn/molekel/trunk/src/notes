This is Molekel 5.4 - development

IMPORTANT:
  Make sure that line separators in input files match
  the file separator of the platform you are running Molekel on;
  e.g. if you have a file that was generated/modified on Windows
  and you want to read that file on Linux then convert the end
  of line separators with dos2unix.
  If end of line separators are not correct you might incur into
  problems when reading GAMESS, Molden and Gaussian files.

Please report any problems through the http://molekel.cscs.ch website

When submitting a bug please make sure you specify
1) Molekel version
2) Operating System
3) Graphics card

Change log
==========

5.4

- Added support for saving images bigger than 3d view window;
  doesn't require offscreen rendering support; works on any card

- Added ability to freely move the bounding box used for computing
  orbital and electron density surfaces; this allows to save time by
  restricting the computation to a specific volume of space

- Added context menu in tree view to speedup interaction with display
  preferences and surface generation

- Added display style button + menu to quickly switch among styles

- Added display of animation sequence number

- Fixed bugs:

  * 675	 - Display geometry number	
  * 1091 - Context menu in tree view
  * 1074 - Density matix not computed for formats other than Gaussian 
  * 1088 - #include directive missing
  * 1089 - wrong operator= in src/utility/shaders/Shaders.cpp
  * 1092 - Save images bigger than Molekel 3D view

5.3.1

- Improved support for low-end and ATI graphics cards

- Works on Vista with Aero turned on

- Fixed bugs:

  * 442  - After a molecule is loaded, it is not selected automatically
  * 443  - Should use ball & stick on smaller molecules
  * 449  - Molden input fails if no basis/mo-coefficients are present
  * 450  - Molden input cannot read frequencies
  * 454	 - Crash when reading gaussian output for anions

  * 1057 - Make latest loaded molecule selected
  * 1059 - Camera interaction not selected automatically


5.3 

- Added support for depth peeling for correct rendering of transparent
  objects; requires an OpenGL 2.0 card and might not work properly on some
  systems. Depth peeling paramters affecting rendering speed/quality of
  transparent object can be set through the Display->View Properties
  dialog.

- Added plot of infrared and Raman spectra with PostScript and PDF output

- Integrated with VTK 5.1 (cvs version since there is no official release yet).

- Added support for anti-aliasing, disabled by default; can be enabled
  through the Display->View Properties dialog.

- It is now possible to change transparency and colors of orbital surfaces.

- Added support for persistent settings in Electron Density Surface dialog.

- Added new x-ray shaders that work properly with VTK 5.1. 

- Fixed bugs:

 * 392 - Add support for multi-molecule Gamess input
 * 401 - Cannot delete Connolly surface
 * 403 - Command line support
 * 404 - Error reading Molden molecular orbital data
 * 405 - Transparency not consistent for both orbital colors
         (dependent on specific card/driver)
 * 406 - Animation runs after deleting the molecule
 * 408 - Feature request: start orbital index from zero
 * 420 - Settings not saved when closing window	
 * 421 - Surface from Grid Data: Elapsed time report wrong
 * 422 - Cannot save animations with transparent SES


5.2

- Added support for GLSL shaders: after a molecule has been selected it is possible
  to assign vertex and pixel shader to the molecule and any generated surface.
  Shader parameters can be saved/loaded to/from text files.
  Only the following data types are currently supported for uniform parameters:
   * float
   * vec2
   * vec3
   * vec4
   * bool
   * int

  If a parameter name contains the string 'color' or 'colour' (case insensitive) it
  is possible to set the value through a color dialog.

  In case shaders are not supported (OpenGL 2.0 required) the shaders menu
  item is disabled.

- Added support for multiple vibrational modes: any number of vibrational
  modes can now be combined to animate atoms.

- Added option in Display menu to hide selection bounding boxes. 

- Added support for record/playback of GUI events, this is mainly used for
  automated GUI testing and demo purposes.

- Animation export can now be interrupted by clicking on the 'stop' button.

- Added optional command line parameters:
  -load <file type> <file path>
  -size <window width> <window height>
  -position <window upper left corner x> <window upper left corner y>
  -settings [<key1 value1> <key2 value2> ...] if not arguments are provided
   current settings info is printed to console
  -events <file path> <initial delay (s)> <time scaling>

- Added support for PNG output.

- Fixed bugs:

  * 382 - Electron density surfaces are not animated
  * 383 - Animation of SES is not reset
  * 384 - Grid data surface dialog's 'Generate' button not disabled
  * 388	- Cannot load GAMESS file with Hessian runs
  * 389	- Cannot load basis set from GAMESS output
  * 390 - Cannot specify file format when saving
  * 393 - Bounding box not updated when animating.
  * 394 - Program may crash when changing animation mode.


5.1.1

- Added support for ADF Tape41 files, look into the data dir for a sample file;
  logging information is currently printed to standard output

- Fixed bugs:

  * 361	- Cannot change selection box color
  * 362	- Cannot unpick atom/bond
  * 363 - Wrong bonds computed
  * 375	- Wrong atom size
  * 376	- MEP scalar bar doesn't change when selecting molecule


5.1

- Removed local documentation: the documentation menu item now opens
  the on-line documentation

- Enhanced visual quality by patching the OpenMOIV library

- Added option to change atom and bond size

- Added option to change the material color for SoCylinder/SoSphere

- Added option to load the atom color table from file (sample color file in data dir)

- Added animation of molecules read from multi-frame PDB and XYZ

- Added option to use cube data as Molecular Electrostatic Potential when computing SAS or SES

- Added Z-matrix format (to build molecule from one z-matrix, see .zmatrix example in data dir)

- Added option to change animation step

- Added option to save one image per molecular orbital (only one molecular orbital
  per-image is displayed in the saved images)

- Added option to smooth with Laplacian smoothing iso-surfaces generated from Gaussian cube files

- Molekel now asks for confirmation before deleting a molecule

- Fixed bugs:
  * 333 - Molecule is scaled when window resized, surface is not
  * 334 - Cannot open file specified on command line.
  * 335 - PDF and PostScript files are not replaced
  * 337 - Loading of PDBs with multiple molecules is slow, adding
          support for multi-frame pdbs has fixed this bug
  * 340 - Molden input issues: Bohr units were not supported
  * 341 - Program may crash when selecting a molecule loaded from pdb: issues
          with OpenBabel::ReadFormula(); see OpenBabel bug 1632403
  * 356 - Cannot load files on Mac OS X: an OpenBabel patch for version 5.0
    has been made available, the new version doesn't need this patch.

Launch from command line
------------------------

Option 1: cd to molekel directory and execute
          > source launch_molekel.<sh/csh> depending on the shell.
          The script will automatically update LD_LIBRARY_PATH
          if needed and launch the program  

Option 2: Modify start_molekel.sh.sample to add
          <molekel home directory>/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH and
          enter the full path of Molekel's executable:
          <molekel home directory>/bin/Molekel.
          No need to cd to Molekel's home dir, the
          'cd ...' line can be commented.


Launch from desktop
------------------
To be able to launch Molekel from KDE and Gnome
you need to modify the script start_molekel.sh.sample
specifying Molekel's home directory (molekel-<version>).
You can then create a launcher/application icon on the
Gnome and KDE desktop and point it to the sh file.
You can change the icon of the desktop shortcut by selecting
the Molekel.png icon in the <molekel root>/resources directory.
When launching from desktop  the launch script will have to 
explicitly cd to Molekel home directory first.
